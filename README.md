## 💡 Key Savings in the Budget Plan

* **Attractions:**

  * Choose 1–2 Oxford colleges instead of 4–5.
  * Skip or reduce Blenheim Palace access (gardens only).
  * In Stratford, visit only Shakespeare’s Birthplace instead of the full combo.
  * Skip Bath Spa.

* **Meals:**

  * Mix in picnics or supermarket meal deals (£5–7 each) instead of £20–25 sit‑down lunches.
  * Pub dinners some days instead of mid‑range restaurants.

* **Transport:**

  * Use local buses to Cotswolds/Dorchester instead of hiring a car for 2 days.
  * Buy advance train tickets and consider a **GroupSave rail discount** (often ⅓ off for groups of 3–9).

✅ With **Budget** you save \~£800 overall while still seeing the main highlights.
✅ With **Comfort** you get premium experiences and more convenience (like punting, spas, car flexibility).
